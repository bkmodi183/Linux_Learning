1. grep 

grep is a command-line utility used to search text using regular expressions.
It prints lines from a file or input that match a given pattern, making it useful 
or quickly filtering logs or text based on specific keywords or patterns.

awk is a more powerful command-line tool with programmable behavior.

in a structured way. With awk, logs and data can be filtered, analyzed, and formatted 
in a more flexible and detailed manner compared to grep.
