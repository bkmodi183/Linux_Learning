1. zcat -> to see the content of zip file or compressed file.
2. head -> To list the top content of file.
           eg. If you want to see the top 5 lines of a file. "head -n 5 file.txt" -> this will show the first five lines of the file. If we don't give the -n flag by default it will give 
               10 lines. Here we have multiple flag like -c,-q,-v. Refer GeeksForGeeks for more info.
3. tail -> Is used to display the last part of the file. 
           eg. "tail -n 5 file.txt" -> it will display the last 5 lines of the file. 
               It has many flags such as -n,-c,-q,-v, -f. Foe better understanding refer gfg
4. tail -f -> The command "tail -f log.txt" is used to conituously monitor the log file in real-time. It will show you the lastes add on logs.
5. wc -> Word Count commnd is used count the number of words in a file.
         eg. wc myfile.txt -> this will give the number of lines, number of words, number of bytes.
6. Hardlink and Softlink -> Here les's assume one eg. In our laptop we used to play a game let's say cricekt247. The file associated with the games are saved inside c/local-disk-c/games/cricket247/icon
                            so every time when we want to play the game we don't ususally go to that path what we do is we create a shortcut icon of the game at the desktop. Here harlink and softlink 
                            are doing the same but in different fashion. When we create a harlink then even if the files get ddeleted from the original path we'll be ablle to access the file via
                            Hardlink which we created at the home. And in Softlink if we delete the source path then the softlink file also gets deleted. 
7. Create a file in the path /home/ubuntu/DevOps/Folder1/cricket247.txt, now everytime we can't go to the path to access the file so what we gonna do is we'll be creating a link at the /ubuntu/ to
   to access the file directly.
  *  ln -s /home/ubuntu/DevOps/Folder1/cricket247.txt softlink-file-cricket247 -> Here ln is link and -s denotes the softlink, the path shows the file for which we're creating the soft link and the 
                                                                                softlink-file-cricket247 denotes the custom name of the softlink file that will reflect at the /home/ubuntu/
  * ls /home/ubuntu/DevOps/Folder1/cricket247.txt Hardlink-file -> This will create a hardlink to that file. Now even if the source file get deleted the hardlink will be there.
8. ls -ltr -> Display more detailed description about the files and directories. With this we can see if there is any link created and for which file path it is refereing to.
9. ls -l, ls -la -> Display the detailed description aboyt the files and directories in certain fashion.                         
10. more -> This command is used to display the content of a file one at a time. "more file.txt". It has various flags. Refere gfg for more details.
11. less -> It allows to vie the content of the file one at a time withoud opening it in an editor. There are various flags associated with this file. For more details refer to gfg.
12. cut -> If you want a small portion of a file content this command is useful. echo "This is myfile" > file.txt
           eg. cut -b 1 file.txt -> output  is: T  Here -b is bytes flags it staes cut the 1 byte form the file and displayed it as an output.
               cut -b 1-4 file.txt -> output is: This Here the cut command cut the 1 to 4 bytes of the file content and displayed it as an output.
13. tee -> reads the standard input and writes it to both the standard output and one or more files. 
          eg. echo "This is file" | tee file.txt -> this will display the file content on shell as well saved the content in the text file.txt
