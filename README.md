# Linux_Learning

Welcome to my **Linux Learning** repository! 🐧

This repository contains all the scripts, configuration files, notes, and exercises I create while learning Linux. The goal is to document my progress, practice commands, and explore different aspects of Linux, from the basics to advanced topics.

## Contents
- **Scripts:** Bash scripts I write to automate tasks.  
- **Notes:** Summaries of Linux commands, concepts, and tutorials.  
- **Exercises:** Practice files for hands-on learning.  
- **Configurations:** Example configuration files for services and applications.

## Purpose
This repository serves as both a **personal reference** and a **learning showcase**, helping me track my growth and share knowledge with others.
